    "-An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal. They are data records that differ dramatically from all others, they distinguish themselves in one or more characteristics. In other words, an outlier is a value that escapes normality and can (and probably will) cause anomalies in the results obtained through algorithms and analytical systems. There, they always need some degrees of attention.\n",
